# What I learned:

The linux course I registered for has been a very fun experience, I geuinely enjoy walking into class everyday and learning new things about linux.

We learned about different distributions of linux, like artix,kali Os,amog Os,uwuntu, and several others. We learned about how certain distros are more stable, while some offer more control over our systems, though at the cost of stability. 
These systems had to be built from scratch, with all of the requirements for the system being up to the users choice.
The more stable distros are deb-based, meaning they won't offer as much freedom,but they will have inbuilt functionality.

The first few classes we spent learning about the various things one can do in the linux terminal.

## cheatsheet
1. grep
2. /proc/cpuinfo
3. oneko
4. cowsay
5. nvim <filename.sh/c>
6. neofetch
7. sudo <command>
8. piping | |
9. ls, cd, mkdir are all basic commands.

## What we learned

1. The first thing we learned to do in the terminal is the neofetch command. It shows us information about our computer's hardware and software along with some ascii art that we can customise to our liking.

2. The second command we learned was how to use /proc/cpuinfo. It shows us information about our processor, like the number of cores it has,the number of processes running, the processing speed of the cpu.

3. We learned of some fun commands, like cowsay, which shows us a cow speaking the words we enter. The cow can take either string input or even a text file, and then repeat the words in a text bubble.

4. We learned how to use the oneko command to summon a small cat that runs around our screen (uwu) and chases our cursor. We can customise it to become a dog as well.

5. The grep command is a very useful command which can be used to search for something within a file on the system. Along with this, we were taught about how linux treats everything as a file, be it a python program or the ram itself.

6. Certain commands are restricted in the terminal, due to not being of high enough power. To evade, or overcome it, we learned about superusers, and how to access their commands with "sudo", which is the short form of superuser do.

7. Vim and its friends were the ones that halted our progress during the class, as we were all stuck on how to operate the unfamiliar text editor that wouldn't let us leave. Not being able to use our mice in vim hindered my progress personally, but as i grew to use it more and more, the mouse is now a lot less useful.

8. Shell script commands were the fun parts, as we learned how to use a program to run commands in the linux terminal for us. It had a steep learning curve, and the brackets still confuse me, but with practice comes perfection.

9. We learned about kernel coding in C in the most recent class (9/11/22). It came with a lot of struggle, as most of us were new to coding with C, and the concepts of makefile were a little confusing. Our SME explained it well, but I will need ot do further research to figure out how to master this sort of coding.

## FINAL THOUGHTS

 I found this course very fun and engaging. I picked this IO course simply because I wanted to explore the world of linux, and explore the freedom it comes with. From everything i have learned in this course, to everything i looked into when I researched myself, I've been convinced that both operating systems come with their merits and demerits. 

Linux is hard to learn by oneself, and only with proper guidance can someone actually integrate themselves into it. Linux does offer you much more control over your system, and the fun commands could keep me occupied for hours. The personalization that it comes with is infinite and the possibilities are endless.

Windows, while more stable as a whole, comes with a lot more restrictions. As a whole, the windows experience is a lot more intuitive, and is easier to explore without a mentor. another plus point of windows is that game support is a lot more available. Many games that I have seen aren't supported on linux which is unfortunate.

 At the end of the day, it all comes down to preference, and the OS one uses is up to the user themselves. I would prefer to dual boot, to keep the merits of both operating systems. In the future, my opinion might change, and with the help of my SME, Siddharth, I hope to increase my knowledge about technology and electronics.
